not_a_cat_lobster,SHIP,"Lobster is the result of an initiative to create a fast and deadly cruiser that would swarm isolated enemy capital ships. Inspired by Hammerhead, this late-domain era cruiser was built around ammofeed system that largely compensates for its seemingly inadequate armament. Contrary to its name, Lobster's armour is agreed to be quite mediocre, and if not for its modern shields, the ship would be an easy prey for any rival with armour-piercing capabilities.

Although on paper Lobster met all requirements, it was viewed with scepticism by Army generals, which was only exacerbated by its poor performance against carriers during military exercises, that fact and the low operational range greatly reduced the initial scale of production. ",,,,
not_a_cat_lobster_lg,SHIP,"The Lion Guard Lobster is part of a programme to increase the use of energy weapons. While the hull itself remained largely untouched, the forward weapon slots were adapted for the use of energy weapons, not only demonstrating a commitment to innovation, but also fully in line with the Supreme Executor's vision! The ammunition feeding system has also been replaced with the highenergyfocus system so favoured by the Lion of Asconia.",,,,
not_a_cat_lobster_p,SHIP,"The Pirate Lobster was rumoured to have been modified by one of Altair Exotech's former employees, kidnapped by pirates during the collapse. This version was stripped of all the safety features and large chunks of armour, resulting in unprecedented speed and manoeuvrability for a cruiser class ship which alongside with greatly increased flux dissipation rate made it indispensable for harassing and destroying lightly armoured civilian targets.",,,,
not_a_cat_lobster_e,SHIP,"The Elite Lobster was the last attempt to retain large orders from the domain military. After the relative failure of its predecessor, it was decided to equip the ship with better armour and heavier weaponry. These efforts were not in vain, and as a result the ship was able to outclass the Dominator in one-on-one combat, something previously only possible with capital class ships. This got people talking and helped get a few medium orders, but due to its high price tag and lack of effectiveness against a large number of smaller opponents, the cruiser lineup was not widely adopted by the military. Despite all this Elite Lobster and its smaller brother became very popular amongst mercenaries and aces.",,,,
not_a_cat_lobster_elg,SHIP,"The idea for the Lion's Guard Elite Lobster was born on the very same day successful Gigacannon trials were completed. The Supreme Executor's eyes were set on all hulls capable of carrying this magnificent weapon, and Altair Exotech's Elite Lobster was considered to be one of them. Inspired by the success with its smaller brother, Andrada's best and most loyal engineers managed to replace the frontal gun's ammofeed with vast array of capacitors required to power the Gigacannon and other energy weapons.",,,,
